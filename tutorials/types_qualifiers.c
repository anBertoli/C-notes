/*
Types can be qualified by using one or more of the
following qualifiers: const, volatile, and restrict. 

The _Atomic type qualifier, available since C11, supports concurrent programs.
*/

// CONST
// Objects declared with the const qualifier (const-qualified types) are not modifiable.
void consts(void) {
    const int a = 1;
    // a = 3;  error

    int i = 12;
    const int j = 12;
    const int *ip = &i;
    const int *jp = &j;
    *(int *)ip = 42; // ok
    *(int *)jp = 42; // undefined behavior
}


// VOLATILE
/*
The values stored in these objects may change without the knowledge
of the compiler. For example, every time the value from a real-time clock
is read, it may change, even if the value has not been written to by the
C program. Using a volatile-qualified type lets the compiler know that
the value may change, and ensures that every access to the real-time clock
occurs (otherwise, an access to the real-time clock may be optimized away
or replaced by a previously read and cached value).
*/

// Without the volatile qualification, the compiler would see this as a
// no-op (a programming statement that does nothing) and potentially elimi-
// nate both the read and the write.
void volat(void) {
    volatile int port;
    port = port;
}



// RESTRICT
/*
A restrict-qualified pointer is used to promote optimization. Objects indirectly
accessed through a pointer frequently cannot be fully optimized because of
potential aliasing, which occurs when more than one pointer refers to the
same object. Aliasing can inhibit optimizations, because the compiler canâ€™t
tell if portions of an object can change values when another apparently
unrelated object is modified, for example.
*/

/*
Because both p and q are restrict-qualified pointers, the compiler
can assume that an object accessed through one of the pointer param-
eters is not also accessed through the other.
*/
void copy(unsigned int n, int * restrict p, int * restrict q) {
    while (n-- > 0) {
        *p++ = *q++;
    }
}
