/*
 * Objects have a storage duration that determines their lifetime. Altogether,
 * four storage durations are available: automatic, static, thread, and allocated.
 *
 * - AUTOMATIC: objects declared within a block or as a function parameter, the
 *              lifetime of these objects begins when the block in which theyâ€™re declared begins execution,
 *              and ends when execution of the block ends
 *
 * - STATIC:    objects declared in file scope have static storage duration. The lifetime of these
 *              objects is the entire execution of the program, and their stored value is initialized
 *              prior to program startup. You can also declare a variable within a block scope to have
 *              static storage duration by using the storage class specifier static.
 *
 * - ALLOCATED: objects dynamically allocated using functions like malloc, calloc, realloc. The lifetime
 *              of these objects begins when the allocation occurs and ends when the objects are manually
 *              freed (with the free function).
 *
 * - THREAD:    storage duration is used in concurrent programming.
 *
 * Scope and lifetime are entirely different concepts. Scope applies to identifiers,
 * whereas lifetime applies to objects. The scope of an identifier is the code region
 * where the object denoted by the identifier can be accessed by its name. The lifetime
 * of an object is the time period for which the object exists.
